A useful set of guidelines to help keep the code nice, clear, and extendable
These are in no particular order.

- Use a linter with the requisite styles, currently Pep8, mccabe, pyflakes

- One object, one file. Keep objects in their own files with clear filenames

- One file, one commit. Stage your changes so each commit clearly reflects the
    changes made to the specific files it appears next to. This is incredibly
    helpful for anyone trying to understand changes made to the code by reading
    commits

    Special note should be taken for moving a function or object from one file
    to another, then it is appropriate to commit both files at once.

    Similarly, if one action has been performed across multiple files, such as
    updating a dependency being moved, that could appropriately be one commit.

    Use your best judgment.

- Have clear and informative commit messages.
