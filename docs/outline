three general categories
    -turn raw data into useful data (QWP)
    -analyze useful data (HSG)
    -output elements as a useful display (UI)

ipg is a separate collection of misc deprecated features
    appears to be split between UI and analysis in the new organization

proposed structure
  src
  |--Stele
      |--analysis
          |--HSGAnalysis (new folder of the compartmentalized hsg object)
      |--processing
          |--QWPProcessing
      |--UI (this one feels out of place, with qwp ui elements within it)
